# MICAS
> MinION Classification & Alerting System is a web application meant to be run simultaneously with the MinION DNA sequencer. This app provides an alerting system through which a scientist performing DNA sequencing runs could be notified through their email or text message. The alerts could be set to respond to any particular sequences of interest arising in their sample. Our team believes that this will enable researchers to use their time more efficiently by allowing them to focus on more important matters in the meantime, rather than waiting around for significant sequences.
